We do not have to carry the weight of the world on our shoulders. We must remain self-critical and accept when we do not have the ability to undertake certain tasks or when we need help to achieve them.

There are technological tools which allow us to organize in real time despite distance, and which allow us to build consensus and make decisions in a decentralised way.

The individual, the community and the territory hold a relationship, and they cannot be understood in silos. In other cultures, there exists other forms of being and existing. The human being and the white male human are not the centre of the universe.

Some things might work, and others might not work. As a result, we recommend developing various possible actions to test which one lands. We recommend not investing all of your energy into one action, as it is hard to predict how the public will react.

In our choice of keywords, we sought to find whether the current public conversation connects Indigenous activism and struggles with climate change – both in Spanish and English speaking spaces. For this, we looked at two types of conversations:\n\n1. Climate Change (General): We tracked conversations around key events of the summer of 2021 like the release of the IPCC report. We also wanted to track the perspective of people who are not necessarily activists or involved in the climate change conversation but who are living in its effects. So we looked for conversations related to recent climate disasters such as hurricanes, fires, floods, fires, droughts, and we cross referenced them with mentions of “climate change”, “global warming”, etc.",

Code is a word or short phrase that labels your data based on the patterns or themes you find.\n\nThere are two types of coding, one is an approach that assigns the codes to the data before retrieving it (deductive). The other type is creating codes once the data is collected and the patterns start to emerge (inductive).  All data can be coded, however, it would be an endless and impractical task to try to code absolutely everything.

This year alone, around the globe, we have already experienced a pandemic, droughts, fires, water crisis, floods, hurricanes, famines and loss of biodiversity at alarming rates. Every year, the number of human and more-than-human life that is displaced as a result of these climate catastrophes increases. This is not a drill, this is an emergency. Never has the future felt so present. It is not an abstract notion anymore.\n\nIn August 2021, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the IPCC), issued an imminent warning: if we do not change the current rates of carbon emission by 2030, the damage would be irreversible and in 2050, human life on the planet could be existentially threatened. It is also important to remember that we will not equally bear the brunt of the climate crisis. Studies show that the majority of the highest carbon emissions per capita come from the richest countries.",

The Central American region, for instance, will be one of the most vulnerable and impacted regions by the climate crisis. According to the World Health Organization, every year, 150 000 people die of diseases, starvation or other health reasons tied to climate change. This number is expected to double by 2030. Again, these deaths mostly occur in developing countries. In the 2015 Paris Agreement, UN Member States set goals to reduce carbon emissions. In general, the international community’s objective has been to regulate the current unsustainable growth model and progressively transition to a green growth model.

The group was brought together by a shared context: increasing threats from the Brazilian government, rapidly increasing deforestation, a rise in illegal mining, and the weekly murders of Indigenous leaders, The four-day meeting was a time for those attending to join forces and denounce the genocide, ethnocide  and ecocide promoted by current goverment policies. It ended with a joint declaration, the Manifesto of Piracu.\n\nThe conversation centered around Indigenous voices. Everyone highlighted the historical nature of such gatherings, the importance of coming together to share stories, songs and solidarity; and the urgency of organizing in the face of the escalating violence from the government and from illegal land grabbers. Old and young voices, female and male in unison shared powerful stories of the challenges they face and of resistance.",

Young and old women energized the conversation with an ‘embodied’ narrative of the struggle and contemporary Indigenous life, where men have often been the ones ‘selling out’ and succumbing to the temptations of capitalism; the opportunity to lease or rent the land to soya farmers or garimpeiros (artisan gold miners), or to loggers. Women offered a fresh perspective and at the same time set the foundational terms for the resistance — allegiance to the land, culture and principles.",
