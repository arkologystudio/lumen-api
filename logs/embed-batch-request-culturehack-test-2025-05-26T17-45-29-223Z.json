In the age of the Anthropocene however, it is important for us to have a much more nuanced understanding of culture. In the last half a century, we have seen new social and cultural systems emerge &#8211; globalization, neoliberalism and social dictatorships. All of which gave warrant to rampant <a class=\"subLink\" href=\"http://culturehack.test/curriculum/module-1-the-culture-of-the-anthropocene/anthropogenic-effects-progress-against-life/\">resource extraction and ecological destruction</a> and <a class=\"subLink\" href=\"http://culturehack.test/curriculum/module-1-the-culture-of-the-anthropocene/anthropogenic-effects-progress-against-people/\">exponential economic inequality and poverty</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is therefore incredibly important that we fully understand the nuance and complexity of the cultural systems that have birthed and sustained the Anthropocene. In contrast to its traditional Enlightenment definition where culture meant the evolution of the human condition, we can see that <a href=\"https://www.organism.earth/library/document/culture-and-ideology-are-not-your-friends\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Culture is not your friend</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, a more contextually relevant definition of <strong>Culture is the normative values and belief systems that coordinate human activity</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through these normative values and belief systems, culture determines how we understand ourselves and our place in the world. The culture of the Anthropocene creates systems of meaning that are inherently dualistic, creating distinctions between social, political and ecological categories e.g. nature/culture, subject/object, knower/object-to-be-known, human/non-human, self/other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of us contribute to and are affected by culture, yet some, more than others have a disproportionate responsibility and benefit. Therefore, culture is both constructed and emergent, as well as visible and invisible simultaneously. We can identify the values of a particular culture simply by making empirical observations within its context, by looking at the social, political and ecological outcomes produced by its cultural system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Understanding that <strong>culture delineates a set of distinctions, assumptions, norms and beliefs about the world</strong> is the key point here. This understanding can help us to develop ways to critically assess our cultural systems and find ways to evolve them beyond Anthropocentrism.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-content-list alignnone mt-8\">\n  \n    <ul class=\"list-none flex flex-col p-0 mx-0 mb-4 max-w-[1280px] mx-auto\">\n                        <li class=\"max-w-2xl flex flex-col gap-2 m-0 mb-3 border-light rounded border shadow hover:bg-light p-2\">\n            <a class=\"!border-0\" href=\"http://culturehack.test/curriculum/curriculum/module-1-the-culture-of-the-anthropocene/anthropogenic-effects-progress-against-life/\">\n              <h2 class=\"border-0 font-sans !text-base !lg:text-lg !font-medium text-primary-base !mb-0\">\n                Anthropogenic Effects: Progress Against Life</h2>\n                          </a>\n                                <li class=\"max-w-2xl flex flex-col gap-2 m-0 mb-3 border-light rounded border shadow hover:bg-light p-2\">\n            <a class=\"!border-0\" href=\"http://culturehack.test/curriculum/curriculum/module-1-the-culture-of-the-anthropocene/anthropogenic-effects-progress-against-people/\">\n              <h2 class=\"border-0 font-sans !text-base !lg:text-lg !font-medium text-primary-base !mb-0\">\n                Anthropogenic Effects: Progress Against People</h2>\n                          </a>\n                                <li class=\"max-w-2xl flex flex-col gap-2 m-0 mb-3 border-light rounded border shadow hover:bg-light p-2\">\n            <a class=\"!border-0\" href=\"http://culturehack.test/curriculum/curriculum/module-1-the-culture-of-the-anthropocene/module-1-notes-culture-and-the-anthropocene/\">\n              <h2 class=\"border-0 font-sans !text-base !lg:text-lg !font-medium text-primary-base !mb-0\">\n                Deep Dive: Culture and the Anthropocene</h2>\n                          </a>\n                  </ul>\n  </div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-footnotes\">\n  <h3 class=\"lg:hidden\">Footnotes</h3>\n  <div class=\"footnotes\">\n    \n<div class=\"wp-block-footnote border-b border-dirty-yellow-base mb-8\">\n  <div class=\"\">\n    \n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>&nbsp;The Anthropocene is our current geological epoch, following the Holocene.
