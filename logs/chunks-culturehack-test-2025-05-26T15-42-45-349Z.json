In your POV statement you listed a series of actions that needed to be taken in order for your narrative intervention to be successful. Narrative reframing is a process that consists of changing the frames you identified to new ones that can support the objectives outlined in your POV statement. Narrative frames are like mental schemas that contain all the information we have learned throughout our life; as such it contains the virtual layer of the narrative form. There are as many narrative frames as there are narrative forms in one culture. We hold all of them, but we act and think differently depending on which narrative frame we have been socialised into.\n\nThe assumption behind narrative reframing is that we can change the current narrative frames around a particular topic to activate new logics, new ideas, truths and beliefs. In this way we can generate new intentions and everyday actions that eventually lead to different material expressions of the narrative form: new speeches, new texts, new images, new sounds, etc.",

Consider the narrative reframing conducted in the Yo Prefiero El Lago campaign. The narrative frame that dominated the narrative space was The Airport is Progress for Mexico.  The team at CHL proposed an alternative narrative frame, We Prefer the Lake:\n\nThe Airport is Progress for Mexico < We Prefer the Lake\n\nUnder the dominant narrative frame – The Airport is Progress for Mexico – the focus was on progress, reinforcing the public belief that building more infrastructure is good. This narrative frame contained the belief that economic growth means progress and therefore the airport is a necessity. For the Atenco community, narrative reframing entailed questioning these capitalist logics and replacing them with other logics that are life-affirming. Thus, the new frame – We Prefer the Lake – does not contain any notion of progress whatsoever.",

The community wanted to change the public conversation by offering an option that did not only revolve around the construction of the airport and the idea that economic progress is an imperative.

The process of reframing narratives entails making the virtual layer perceptible and changing them to better reflect the beliefs and ideas we seek to promote in this world. Narrative reframing is a profoundly reflective and inward-looking exercise to make us question the cultural narratives we take for granted by looking below their surface. We can find evidence of narratives in our everyday lives, such as conversations, media and other cultural artefacts. However, these cultural artefacts reflect much deeper layers of the narrative that are normally not visible, nor are they easily accessible.

The virtual layer drives human behaviour, actions and expressions. For simplicity let us focus on three key aspects – metaphors, truth constructs and ideologies (see Module 2). For step one in the narrative reframing process consider the  following  key questions to uncover these aspects:\n\nMETAPHOR: This aspect involves reflecting on and questioning what kind of metaphors are hidden behind a narrative frame. Recall from Module 2 that metaphors not only structure the way we communicate but also how we make sense of the world, they are cognitive structures that we often do not question. In the YPEL case study, for example, the frame “ The Airport is Progress for Mexico” utilises the metaphor that development and progress are growth. We understand growth through our bodies and it evokes a sense of ‘natural development’ which is associated with life.",

In the YPEL case study for example, in order to believe that the Airport is Progress (frame), and that progress is good (metaphor), it is necessary to believe that nature is a commodity (truth construct). Only then can you agree to destroying an ecosystem to build the airport.\n\nIDEOLOGY:  This aspect refers to the cultural context and the ‘justification for action’ that is held by society. In the YPEL case study, for example, the ideology was Neoliberalism.\n\nExplore Further:\n\nWatch this scene from They Live (1988) and The Pervert’s Guide to Ideology – do you think Ideology is like a pair of sunglasses? Explain.\n\nFigure 2: Analysing the YPEL Frame\n\nIn this diagram, we can see how ideology, metaphors and truth constructs contribute to a frame and thereby guide actions, by creating new concepts and intentions in the narrative form.\n\nStep 2: Change the metaphor, truth & Ideology",

Once again, we can use the YPEL example to show how this can be done.\n\nMETAPHOR: You must think of other metaphors that can reflect your narrative objectives. In the YPEL case study, the narrative objective was to think of the lake as a living being thus the metaphor of economic growth was replaced by the lake is life.\n\nLOGICs:  The metaphor naturally is related to the truth you wish to enact. In the YPEL campaign, an animistic view of the world allowed people to tap into the belief that all beings and things on this planet are alive. As a result, the truth construct changed from Nature is a commodity to Nature is alive and is sentient. The corresponding logic of this is that ‘for me to exist, the lake must exist’.",

We advise you to come up with several frames. Be intuitive, tap into your knowledge and instinct, and keep in mind your Point of View statement and your narrative objectives. It can be useful to adopt a forward-thinking mindset. What kind of ideas, intentions, actions, behaviours and material expressions could be unlocked from the new narrative frame you are proposing?

There is not only one way to answer “What is the truth construct? What is the ideology? What is the metaphor?” Similarly, there is no such thing as a single, perfect narrative frame.

Always keep your narrative objectives in mind (that you identified at the end of module 6).\n\nDeep Dive: why we reframe narratives\n\nBefore outlining how to build a narrative strategy, let’s zoom out and understand the bigger picture behind why we reframe. Recall in Module 3 you learned about cultural evolution (an onto-shift towards an inter-being narrative environment); in Module 6 you mapped different narrative communities on an appropriate mapping framework (such as the knowledge-system framework). Here in Module 7 we are reframing the narratives of the narrative communities in order to evolve culture.",

We can visualise this “onto-shift” using the mapping framework from Module 6. As you can see in the diagram, we want to move narrative communities or clusters of narrative communities into the top right quadrant so their logics evolve to support a more regenerative system and a higher plurality of knowing. This is cultural evolution.\n\nThe second aim is the unity or harmonisation of narratives and narrative communities through their underlying logics, so we are more likely to convince the critical mass of the public needed to shift culture in the direction of life-affirming futures.\n\nThe theory of change behind this onto-shift is based on the idea of the “Overton window”, or “window of discourse” which describes the range of political ideas deemed acceptable to the public.",

Read more about this theory of change.\n\nThe Narrative Strategy\n\nNow that you have developed a new narrative frame, you need to create a narrative strategy around these new frames. Recall that in Modules 4, 5, and 6 you developed a Point of View Statement, a listening model, and a coherent map of the narrative landscape. We are now able to determine the key parameters for conducting a “culture hack”.

For this, we conduct a mapping based on the System-Knowledge framework. This mapping between ways of ‘knowing’ and modes of ‘being’, is essentially a mapping of power relations and the potential for capacities for cultural evolution. Locating our narrative communities in this framework can help us to project our future narrative intervention, as well as to understand the relationship of each community with a way of knowing and relating to the world we inhabit.\n\nNote: you are free to adapt the axes to fit with your own goals (outlined in the POV), but the system-knowledge framework is a good backup or can provide inspiration.

They feed on the conception of knowledge as being single and unique, forged by European modernity leading to an empire that rules the cognitive realm.

These hubs of discussions shape and influence narratives on a specific topic.\n\nNarrative Communities are the crux of Culture Hack Labs’ methodology. Our goal in the next part of the Understand Phase is to map these communities and their underlying belief systems to inform our narrative strategy.

What are you most interested in listening to? Your listening model codifies the different activities you will have to engage in in order to answer this question.\n\nWe differentiate between two types of listening, big and small listening. Big listening uses big data sets to find answers. This is normally collected by social listening tools. Small listening is the manual collection of data, this could include interviews, questionnaires and surveys.\n\nThe key outcome here is for you to determine what types of listening you need to do given your point of view.
