We then looked at how to reframe our narrative and embed these messages to reach the target audience. We have planned and established the conditions to hack into the public conversation, whether it is by actively generating momentum or whether it is by seizing the opportunity of a moment to make our message viral.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important to note that the process of launching a culture hack is an iterative one, that involves trials and errors. Some things might work, and others might not work. As a result, we recommend developing various possible actions to <strong>test which one lands</strong>. We recommend not investing all of your energy into one action, as it is hard to predict how the public will react. Remember culture hacking is an iterative process and involves an ongoing prototyping of messages and content.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think of your first actions as test cases. As you launch these first actions, it is important to <strong>monitor and evaluate their results. </strong>This is how you will be able to fine tune and re-design actions that you will be able to launch again. There begins a cycle of testing, monitoring and iterating. For the iterative cycle, monitoring and evaluation of data that is collected is critical. We use it to understand our narrative environment, we use it again to understand whether and how we can change this narrative environment.

You have also thought about the kind of emotions you want to convey.&nbsp; At this point, before they have been shown to the public, these are prototypes. You can test them to be able to see which message and/or meme performs better so you can triage (assign degrees of urgency) and fine-tune your messages.

There are different types of metrics that are worth collecting, depending on the media format you have chosen for your culture hack. For social media as an example, you could collect data regarding reach (number of views), engagement (likes, retweets, reactions, comments, etc.) and sentiments. You could also monitor to see if your message is being picked up by other media, and if it is changing the tenor of the narrative space. So identifying the specific metrics or data points you want to measure or track for your message is the first step; from here you can now choose which measurement tool is best suited to collect the data you wish to evaluate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>*As a disclaimer, the listed tools below are designed for marketing purposes and not necessarily culture hacking. This points to the necessity of creating tools for life-centric culture change such as the CHL Platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A / B testing&nbsp;</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>A/B testing consists of comparing how two sets of messages fare when they are presented to the target audience. Group A and Group B are shown two different messages, so you can see what types of response each generates. This type of testing is great when deciding which message to use compared to another message.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1159714227408868\">Facebook A/B testing</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Randomized controlled trials</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>A randomised controlled test seeks to measure the effectiveness of a message by comparing the reactions of Group A, who has seen the message, with the reactions of Group B, who has not seen the message (control group). Both groups are asked the same questions. The greater the difference between Group A&#8217;s and Group B’s reactions, the more effective your message.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.swayable.com/\">Swayable</a>&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Focus groups</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Focus groups allow you to get direct feedback from the public. A focus group is constituted by selecting members of the public that can be representative of your target audience. You can have different focus groups that represent different types of audiences. This enables you to compare the reaction of a particular audience with another and to adapt your message and strategy accordingly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Social media monitoring</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Most social media platforms allow you to gather data on key metrics such as reach (how many people have seen your content) and engagement (how many people have engaged with it). In this way, you&nbsp; can know how many people have seen your message on social media, and how many people have reacted to it. There are also external softwares that can collect this type of data. It is also possible and advisable to monitor news media outlets to scout for any change in language and to see if they are picking your new narrative frames.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/help/735720159834389\">Facebook Ad manager</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://keyhole.co/\">Keyhole</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://mediacloud.org/\">Media cloud</a>&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Surveys</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Surveys are the most common form of data gathering. Through a set of questions and audience criteria, surveys enable you to poll a segment of the population on any topics. Designing survey questions should not be underestimated. It is also something that can be outsourced. This type of tool is useful to gauge a change in the narrative space, if your frames are being picked up and therefore, if your message and meme have worked.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://today.yougov.com/about/about-the-yougov-panel/\">YouGov</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/surveys/\">Google marketing survey</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Iterate</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The last step of the iterative cycle is to tweak your messages and strategy according to the results of the monitoring and evaluation processes. Maybe, it is an image; maybe, it is the wording. Maybe, it is about the moment or the audience. This stage allows you to follow the narrative frame to see how it behaves and reiterate your hack to further align with your goals. Some questions to consider:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Are the narrative communities responding to your message?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Was the tone appropriate for the moment in the conversation?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>What worked in this iteration and what could be improved?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-light-background-color has-background is-layout-constrained wp-container-core-group-is-layout-2 wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\" style=\"border-style:none;border-width:0px;border-radius:2px;padding-top:var(--wp--preset--spacing--40);padding-right:var(--wp--preset--spacing--40);padding-bottom:var(--wp--preset--spacing--40);padding-left:var(--wp--preset--spacing--40)\">\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Activity 2</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Using this worksheet as a template, you will plan your monitoring and evaluation of your narrative intervention. In the first row write the message you are testing in this iterative cycle.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Column A, identify the tool you will use to monitor the performance of your message (survey, focus groups, A/B testing etc).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Column B, identify the metric you will measure for your messages (emotional response, reach, engagement, volume of conversation etc.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Column C, identify the timeline, how long you will monitor your narrative intervention.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Column D, write down the learnings and insights you get from the data and in the final column, identify next steps and actions to take to re-fine and re-launch your messages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As this is a simple template, you are invited to download this worksheet, adapt and customise it to include other aspects you would like to monitor and evaluate during this process, according to your own particular needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td colspan=\"5\"><strong>TEST MESSAGE 1:&nbsp;</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>TOOL</strong></td><td><strong>DATA POINT&nbsp; / METRIC</strong></td><td><strong>TIMELINE</strong></td><td><strong>EVALUATION</strong></td><td><strong>NEXT STEPS</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>1.</strong></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>2.</strong></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>3.</strong></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"5\"><strong>TEST MESSAGE 2:</strong></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><strong>DATA POINT&nbsp; / METRIC</strong></td><td><strong>TIMELINE</strong></td><td><strong>EVALUATION</strong></td><td><strong>NEXT STEPS</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>1.</strong></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>2.</strong></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>3.</strong></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"5\"><strong>TEST MESSAGE 3:</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>MONITORING TOOL</strong></td><td><strong>DATA POINT&nbsp; / METRIC</strong></td><td><strong>TIMELINE</strong></td><td><strong>EVALUATION</strong></td><td><strong>NEXT STEPS</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>1.</strong></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>2.</strong></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>3.</strong></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"5\"><strong>TEST MESSAGE 4:</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>MONITORING TOOL</strong></td><td><strong>DATA POINT&nbsp; / METRIC</strong></td><td><strong>TIMELINE</strong></td><td><strong>EVALUATION</strong></td><td><strong>NEXT STEPS</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>1.</strong></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>2.</strong></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>3.</strong></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n</div>\n",

It is also possible and advisable to monitor news media outlets to scout for any change in language and to see if they are picking your new narrative frames.\n\nSurveys\n\nSurveys are the most common form of data gathering. Through a set of questions and audience criteria, surveys enable you to poll a segment of the population on any topics. Designing survey questions should not be underestimated. It is also something that can be outsourced. This type of tool is useful to gauge a change in the narrative space, if your frames are being picked up and therefore, if your message and meme have worked.\n\nIterate\n\nThe last step of the iterative cycle is to tweak your messages and strategy according to the results of the monitoring and evaluation processes. Maybe, it is an image; maybe, it is the wording. Maybe, it is about the moment or the audience. This stage allows you to follow the narrative frame to see how it behaves and reiterate your hack to further align with your goals. Some questions to consider:\n\nActivity 2\n\nUsing this worksheet as a template, you will plan your monitoring and evaluation of your narrative intervention. In the first row write the message you are testing in this iterative cycle.\n\nIn Column A, identify the tool you will use to monitor the performance of your message (survey, focus groups, A/B testing etc).\n\nIn Column B, identify the metric you will measure for your messages (emotional response, reach, engagement, volume of conversation etc.)\n\nIn Column C, identify the timeline, how long you will monitor your narrative intervention.\n\nIn Column D, write down the learnings and insights you get from the data and in the final column, identify next steps and actions to take to re-fine and re-launch your messages.\n\nAs this is a simple template, you are invited to download this worksheet, adapt and customise it to include other aspects you would like to monitor and evaluate during this process, according to your own particular needs.",

Our data collection captured a conversation dating back to May of 2021.

In our choice of keywords, we sought to find whether the current public conversation connects Indigenous activism and struggles with climate change &#8211; both in Spanish and English speaking spaces. For this, we looked at two types of conversations:</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>1. Climate Change (General): </em></strong><em>We tracked conversations around key events of the summer of 2021 like the release of the IPCC report.

      "extractedText": "This listening model pursued big listening. They developed their keywords used to search for relevant narratives to listen to, based on their consideration of the demographics, themes, platforms, date range, geography, of the spaces they wanted to listen to (outlined in the section “Listening to Narratives” of this module).\n\nOverview:\n\nIndigenous Peoples are 6.2% of the world’s population but their territories contain almost 80% of the planet’s remaining biodiversity. In the heart of those diverse ways of knowing & being, beats resilience: for more than 500 years, indigenous nations around the world have dealt with systems of oppression that threaten bodies, territories and cultures. This project focuses on co-creating replicable and scalable narratives, tools and practices with indigenous peoples as an amplifier of movements in defense of cultural and ecological diversity in times of climate crisis, pandemics and war.\n\nObjectives:\n\nFor our Indigenous futures case study, data collection began in August 2021 until October 2021. Our data collection captured a conversation dating back to May of 2021. We researched both English speaking and Spanish speaking in narrative spaces to ensure that our data did not only reflect a Global North perspective. In our choice of keywords, we sought to find whether the current public conversation connects Indigenous activism and struggles with climate change – both in Spanish and English speaking spaces. For this, we looked at two types of conversations:\n\n1. Climate Change (General): We tracked conversations around key events of the summer of 2021 like the release of the IPCC report. We also wanted to track the perspective of people who are not necessarily activists or involved in the climate change conversation but who are living in its effects. So we looked for conversations related to recent climate disasters such as hurricanes, fires, floods, fires, droughts, and we cross referenced them with mentions of “climate change”, “global warming”, etc.\n\n2. Indigenous Climate Spaces: We also focused on Indigenous narrative spaces by looking at specific movements or current issues through keywords #Landback, #StopLine3, Indigenous people against carbon report, etc. We wanted to understand how Indigenous communities addressed climate change and/or connect it to their current problems or resistance.\n\nThe data led us to spend some time on social media, reading posts, looking at comments to get a better understanding of the conversation.\n\nThe table below identifies our key search criteria, the date range of collection & related objectives:",
