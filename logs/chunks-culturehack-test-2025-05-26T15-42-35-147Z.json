These can be embedded into a variety of formats and propagated throughout the public conversation: media campaigns, images, videos, etc. The intention here is to create a viral message that can spread and shape the narrative space. There are five steps in this process that allow us to hack cultural narratives. Taking into account the narrative strategy we created in Module 7, we can now step into the process of creating communication artefacts for the hack.\n\nThis module outlines 5 steps:\n\nStep 1: The Message\n\nStep 2: The Meme (the hashtag or slogan)\n\nStep 3: The Tone (the emotions we want to convey)\n\nStep 4: The Media (creative content & modes of communication)\n\nStep 5: The Moment (scale and appropriate moment to intervene)\n\nStep 1: The Message",

By way of reminder, while a narrative frame contains our deepest logics – those which guide the expression of our ideas and actions – messages are the actual manifestation of those narrative frames in the material world (the tip of the iceberg).\n\nLanguage is a key building block of any message. And, indeed, linguistics teaches us that our choice of word matters. Depending on the adjectives and verbs we choose or whether we use the active or the passive voice, the impact of the message on our audience will be different. How we choose and assemble words enables us to highlight certain things and hide others. With carefully selected language, a message can maximise the potential of the narrative frames.",

To determine which way to go, it is important to consider your target audience. What do they respond to? What motivates them? What angers them? What do they seek?

A “meme” is a unit of culture that has the capacity to self-replicate and spread rapidly from person to person. We are, of course, familiar with the memes we share online every day, but what makes a meme a meme is its virality, which acts as a super spreader for the idea it contains. This phenomenon existed long before the internet.\n\nOur culture contains a multiplicity of memes. A meme can be a hashtag (“Black Lives Matter”), an image (a black square posted on social media in support of the Black Lives Matter movement), a fashion garment (the green bandana of the feminist movement in Latin America), a tune (for many of us born before the internet, we associate the internet with the sound the router used to make when it connected). These are mere examples. A meme can exist in a variety of forms.",

Symbols are socially accepted conventions that establish a relationship between an identity and a reality. As a result, symbols evoke and represent that reality. There are longstanding symbols, for instance, a country flag represents a nationality. The dove represents peace. There are also symbols that are being created every day. An artist like Banksy has created symbols like rats and monkeys to represent the human race and critique society.\n\nTo find existing symbols, ask yourself:\n\nYou can then consider using this symbol or you can replace them to generate a different reaction from the audience. When changing symbols, the goal is to replace mental associations with other ones. Metaphors can be useful in finding new symbols. For example, a thumbs up (symbol) rests upon the metaphor that “up” is “good” and “down” is “bad”.",

This is partly how we can interpret “BlackOutTuesday”, the black square on social media that went viral and whose original intent was to protest against the art industry for profiting off of black artists and yet not saying anything in support of Black Lives Matter.\n\nTo change symbols ask yourself the following questions:\n\nBe nimble, specific, and minimalist. #LessIsMore. A meme is more easily shared when it is simple & easy to understand by a number of people. It is easier to share a GIF than a dissertation.\n\nStep 3: The Tone\n\nThe third step in the process is tone. It is important to think of the emotions you wish to evoke when spreading your meme & your messages.

The same applies to a culture hack.\n\nWe must understand and analyse the sentiments of a public conversation, as this gives us an indication of where we can intervene. In this regard, there are two things to pay attention to (1) general patterns of emotion (sentiment) that exist over time within the narrative communities (2) temporary emotional reactions or public responses to a particular event.

He argued that our primary emotions are an evolutionary development and that the response to each emotion is the one that is likely to deliver the highest level of survival possibility. The model is simple and there are greater emotional nuances not captured within it, but we can use this as a starting point for narrative hacking.\n\nIn this theory, the most influential role of emotions is to help us survive. And so emotions can be an important component when we want to generate a specific reaction in our audiences. To create triggers that generate certain emotions, we must think of creative content and visual narratives that can allow us to convey these emotions. This is a crucial moment to bring in creatives and artists who know how to translate emotions into material forms: poets, musicians, radio people, filmmakers, designers, dancers…",

The appropriate media is the one that will achieve the most impact among the audiences you want to communicate to. It is the format that is the most likely to be understood and shared by the audience you have picked. As a result, the fourth step in the process involves knowing your audience well enough to select the most appropriate media of communication to reach the target narrative communities. For this, we must use the information we gathered during your listening model as well as in your narrative strategy where we have built profile-types of the audience we want to target according to age range, gender, political opinions, and socio-economic situations.",

Some questions to consider:\n\nStep 5: The Moment & Space\n\nSpace and scale are as important as the message, the meme, the tone and the media when planning a culture hack. Choosing the space for your culture hack is akin to a political declaration because power dynamics exist both in private and public spaces.

It means choosing who gets to see the message, where the message is placed and how often it is repeated. If we think like a graffiti artist for example, a graffiti tag inside a train will be consistently seen by passengers inside the train. A graffiti “bombing” on the outside of the train will be consistently seen by people passing by in a car or those who live near train tracks.

To identify the frames, we must first focus on the metaphors, logics and ideology in the messages.\n\nMetaphors used in the messages give us the most insights. Metaphors are comparisons between two things. That means we can understand one thing in terms of another.  For example, the metaphor ‘the economy is growing’ invokes the sensation of natural growth.  The frame here is economic growth. The logic that sustains this frame is that we can grow the economy infinitely on a finite planet. The ideology behind that is neoliberalism.",

Narrative reframing is the process of transforming frames in the narrative communities you identified to support your narrative objectives.\n\nRecall (from Module 2) that the narrative form has a visible, material layer and invisible, virtual layer. The process of reframing narratives entails making the virtual layer perceptible and changing them to better reflect the beliefs and ideas we seek to promote in this world.\n\nThe parts of the virtual layer we focus on in the reframing process are the metaphors, truth constructs and ideologies.\n\nThe easiest way for us to access this is by understanding frames, through understanding a frame we can surface the metaphors, truth constructs and ideologies.\n\nIf you need a refresher of the narrative form, refer to Module 2: Understanding Narratives.",
